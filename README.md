Let me know a bit more about:

What was the actual project topic or tasks they gave you? (e.g., data visualization, machine learning, web dev, etc.)

Which tools or tech stack did you use?

Once you tell me that, I can help you write the Features, Tech Stack, and maybe even a README file ready to upload. Want that?
